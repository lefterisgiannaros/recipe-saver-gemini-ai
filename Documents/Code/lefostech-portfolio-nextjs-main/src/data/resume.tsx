    // "At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go fulltime into building and scaling my own SaaS businesses. In the past, [I pursued a double degree in computer science and business](/#education), [interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LJ2e5qKdE), and [competed in over 21 hackathons for fun](/#hackathons). I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person cohort of buildspace called [buildspace sf1](https://buildspace.so/sf1).",
    "At the end of 2022, I focused entirely on front-end development with Vue.js and implemented various automations to streamline processes. Previously, I led a team for cloud ERP software support and worked on performance optimization and ads tracking. Currently, Iâ€™m actively learning and exploring React.js to further expand my skills.",
